# Predator-Prey Simulation

This project is a JavaFX-based simulation of a predator-prey scenario, where a wolf hunts rabbits on a grid. The simulation includes the following features:

- A grid-based board where animals move.
- Multithreaded implementation for animal movement.
- Adjustable parameters for grid size, number of rabbits, and movement delay.
- GUI interaction to pause and resume animals.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have JavaFX set up in your environment.
2. Compile and run the `SimulationApp` class.

## Features

- **Grade 3.0**: Basic movement of animals on the grid.
- **Grade 4.0**: Wolf hunts rabbits, and simulation ends when only the wolf remains.
- **Grade 5.0**: GUI interaction to pause and resume animals.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
